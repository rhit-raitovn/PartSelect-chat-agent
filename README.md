   - Contextual suggestions
   - Mobile responsive

3. **Technically Excellent**
   - Modern best practices
   - Hybrid intent classification
   - Function calling architecture
   - Clear scaling path

4. **Well-Documented**
   - 10,000+ words of docs
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Setup automation
   - Video walkthrough

5. **Extensible**
   - Easy to add tools
   - Easy to add products
   - Modular design
   - Configuration-driven
